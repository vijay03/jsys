Journal of Systems Research (JSYS)
==================================
There is a need for an open-access, free-for-authors, free-for-readers, high-quality journal for systems research. This repository contains a proposal for such a journal.

## Why do we need a new journal in systems?

1. Top venues like SOSP/OSDI and Eurosys don't do revisions: good work that is not perfect gets rejected and bounced around (wastes both author and reviewer cycles).
2. Artificial constraints like being single track limit the number of papers accepted and presented.
3. Coupling publication and conference attendance is unfortunate, shutting out authors from countries like Iran and authors who simply don't have the money to travel
4. Conference papers also have an unfortunate limit on number of pages both in the submission version and in the final camera-ready version. Some conferences require authors to pay significant amount of money (e.g., $150) per extra page in the camera-ready version.

These problems would all be solved by moving to a journal format. The
quality would remain high, similar to SOSP/OSDI and Eurosys.

Conferences would still remain, but they would be explicitly for networking. Authors can publish without attending the conference. 

### Why not use an existing journal like ACM TOS?

To ensure the open-access mission of the journal is carried out
properly, it must be governed by an independent board. Existing
journals such as Transactions on Computing Systems are all governed by
organizations such as ACM, which have a different mission and set of
values.

## How would the journal work? 

JSYS would work in a manner similar to PVLDB. Authors can submit to
the journal on the first of every month. By the first of the following
month, the authors will receive a decision: accept, revise, or
reject. A revise decision means the authors can submit a revised
manuscript 1--3 months after getting the decision.

**Continuous Interaction**. During the one month of review, there will be
continuous interaction between the authors and reviewers via
HotCRP (in a double blind manner). In this way, the need for rebuttal
is eliminated. The continuous, anonymized communication helps clears
mis-understandings. 

**Non-confrontational review**. The goal of all reviewers to identify
what needs to be done to get the paper to a publishable
state. There are no constraints such as acceptance rate. The authors
can then choose whether to perform the work identified by the
reviewers to publish in this journal.


## Role of students

We hope to include senior graduate students as reviewers in the
journal. The reviewer set will also include established
researchers, to ensure the grad-student reviewers are calibrated. 

We think there are many benefits to including senior graduate students
as reviewers: they have more time than faculty to do deeper reviews,
they are more enthusiastic about the review process, and they are more
open to learning how to write good reviews. We also suspect they are
less likely to turn in late or extremely short reviews. There is not a
significant difference in review quality between a senior grad student
and someone who has just graduated.

## Timeline 

It will take time before the journal becomes "prestigious". Several
new conferences such as NSDI and Eurosys significantly increased in
quality since their founding; we expect it will be the same with the
journal. We expect it will be five to seven years before the journal
is considered "top". 

## How would we fund the journal if we are not charging authors or readers? 

The journal will rely on volunteer work, similar to most computer
science conferences. It is not expensive to host the papers published
in the journal. The journal will not offer type-setting or
copy-editing: the authors will do this themselves (this is common in
computer science conferences). In this manner, the journal takes
advantage of characteristics unique to computer science research.

Similar journals such as the Journal of Machine Learning Research
(JMLR) have been open access for over 20 years without charging
readers or authors. The publisher [shares](https://blogs.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficient-journal/) the biggest expense is
filing taxes.
