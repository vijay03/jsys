Journal of Systems Research (JSYS)
==================================
There is a need for an open-access, free-for-authors, free-for-readers, high-quality journal for systems research. This repository contains a proposal for such a journal.

## Why do we need a new journal in systems?

1. Top venues like SOSP/OSDI and Eurosys don't do revisions: good work that is not perfect gets rejected and bounced around (wastes both author and reviewer cycles).
2. Artificial constraints like being single track limit the number of papers accepted and presented.
3. Coupling publication and conference attendance is unfortunate, shutting out authors from countries like Iran and authors who simply dont have the money to travel
4. Conference papers also have an unfortunate limit on number of pages both in the submission version and in the final camera-ready version. Some conferences require authors to pay significant amount of money (e.g., $150) per extra page in the camera-ready version.

These problems would all be solved by moving to a journal format. The quality would remain high, similar to SOSP/OSDI and Eurosys. 

Conferences would still remain, but they would be explicitly for networking. Authors can publish without attending the conference. 

### Why not use an existing journal like ACM TOS?

To ensure the open-access mission of the journal is carried out properly, it must be governed by an independent board. Existing journals such as Transactions on Computing Systems are all governed by organizations such as ACM, which have a different mission and set of values. 

## How would the journal work? 

JSYS would work in a manner similar to PVLDB. Authors can submit to the journal on the first of every month. By the first of the following month, the authors will receieve a decision: accept, revise, or reject.
